Welcome to microservice-apache-kafka project This Spring Boot application is designed to showcase the functionality 
of Apache Kafka by implementing both a producer and a consumer. Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming 
platform that allows for the building of real-time streaming data pipelines and applications. In this project, 
the producer component generates messages and sends them to a Kafka topic, while the consumer component reads 
these messages from the topic and processes them accordingly. Through this demonstration, you can explore how Kafka facilitates asynchronous communication between different parts of your system, 
enabling efficient and scalable data processing. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the project, and start exploring the power of Apache Kafka in your applications!
